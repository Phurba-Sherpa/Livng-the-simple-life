                <p class="about-desc">I used to be a pack rat. I had so many things that I thought that I loved,
                    but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too much.
                </p>
                <p class="about-desc">
                    Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in. and I
                    couldn't hold a relationship.

                <h3 class="experience-title">How I turned things around</h3>
                <p class="about-desc">I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything. I literally
                    put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I
                    quit my job.
                </p>
                <p class="about-desc">
                    It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what
                    else to do. And it worked.
                </p>

                <h3 class="experience-title">How I live the simple life</h3>
                <p class="about-desc">Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less
                    stressed, enjoy life and work more. and I have more free time to enjoy.
                </p>
                <p class="about-desc">
                    With how much it turned my life around, I felt tike I had no choice but to start sharing
                    how I did it, and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I
                    started this site!
